/*
* Design and implement a data structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
 * It should support the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity,
 it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this problem,
  when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.

Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?
